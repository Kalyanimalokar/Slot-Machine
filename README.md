This project is a simple slot machine game implemented in JavaScript. It allows players to deposit money, place bets on multiple lines, spin the slot machine, check for winnings, and play again if desired. It's a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the importance of breaking down big tasks into smaller parts for easier problem-solving.
